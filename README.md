This is a simple program that hides the mouse cursor by pressing hot keys. It uses the [Nomousy](https://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/2083-nomousy-disablehide-your-mouse-pointer-cmd/) utility to hide the cursor. It is required to have this utility in the same directory as the executable file.

Here is the compiled version for Windows: [Google_Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1np-x9KuQZ14ahYypqajfLJsOdMMmQ6K9/view?usp=sharing)

**Nomousy** is a utility for **Windows**, so now only the **Hidemouse** version for Windows makes sense.
